## Firmware
The cybr36 runs ZMK firmware which can be found on my profile [here](https://github.com/Sleepyboi7973/zmk-config-cybr36).


## Case Printing Tips
Print the plate at 100% size and the case at 101.5% size to ensure that the pcb and plate fit inside without issue. I printed my case with no top or bottom layers, no supports, and triangular infill at 30%
